# Welcome to ChitChat

ChitChat is a web platform where foreign classrooms connect in real-time for language and cultural exchange with peers, all with the safety of supervision by their teachers. Traditional, classroom-based methods of language education fail to leverage the potential for growth through peer interaction across cultural and geographic divides.

_Tech stack: React, TypeScript, Sass, Socket.io, JWT, Express, PostgresSQL with Sequelize hosted on AWS RDS_
