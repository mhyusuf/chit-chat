### ChitChat

is a platform for classrooms studying each other's language to connect in real-time for language and cultural exchange, all with the safety of supervision by their teachers. Native speakers of each language are able to offer key insights on current useage patterns and modern vocabulary. The platform is intended to supplement and improve traditional, classroom-based methods of language education.

This prototype of allows for live chat in small groups, with both text and short-form audio messaging leveraging peer-to-peer technologies unrepresented in classroom models of language education. Teachers can also assign tasks to students, who then submit their work by uploading a prepared file (eg .doc, .pptx, .pdf, etc). Students can comment on each other's submitted work to give constructive feedback.

We hope to deploy future iterations of ChitChat to allow for more meaningful interaction with foreign languages and their native speakers.
